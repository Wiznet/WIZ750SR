<details markdown="1">   
<summary>Boot V1.3 history</summary>

v1.3.2 Stable
- Bug fixes:
   - Fixed pin mapping : DSR pin of WizZ750SR-100/105/110

v1.3.1 Stable
- Bug fixes:
  - When exception situation of TCP Connection - Class C private IP
When the module IP and Remote IP is 192.168.xx.xx and third ip is different for each, ARP request operation is not transmitted.(This part had deleted)


v1.3.0 Stable
- Bug fixes:
  - When APP firmware is uploading using the configuration Tool and Board is power off, the product not operate.
  - DHCP Lease Time :  when _DHCP_DEBUG_ enable, DHCP Lease Time is fixed as 10 second. 
  	- DHCP lease time is modified to use it that information of received packet from DHCP Server.
  - The Status LED(PA_07) of  WIZ750SR_1xx doesn't operate.
    - The Status LED(PA_07) of  WIZ750SR_1xx is modified. Turning on an LED and making it blink once per second.
  - Compare DHCP Server IP :  When DHCP OFFER Packet receive from DHCP Server,the DHCP server ip in packet compare with previous DHCP Server IP.
- Improvements:
  - The ISR address have changed to fixed address. The ISR address of APP did no more have to need copy and use in Boot.

### latest F/W version(Boot V1.2)
v1.2.9 Stable
- Improvements:
   - Added in order to remove some unused functions
   - Modified flag of socket when socket function use(Non Block)


<details markdown="1">   
**<summary>Boot V1.2 history</summary>**

v1.2.8 Stable
- Bug fixes:
   - Fixed pin mapping : DSR pin of WizZ750SR-100/105/110

v1.2.7 Stable
- Bug fixes: All bug fixed described at upper v1.3.0 and v1.3.1 except Impovements.

v1.2.6 Stable
- Bug fixes:
  - If serial data packing 'time' option  is less than 500ms, the first serial data(+++) ignored in GW mode.

- Improvements:
  - While IP address allocate using DHCP,
    the device can be made searchable using the Configuration tool and it can change the mode(AT mode <-> GW mode).
    - While IP address is allocating using DHCP , it can change the AT mode. It can show that the status of channel change from ATmode to OPEN in Configuration tool. So AT command didn't operate.    
 

v1.2.5 Stable
- Bug fixes:
  - Modyfied the setSn_DHAR() Address offset.
  - Modyfied the WIZ750SR-110 HW_Trigger pin.

- Improvements:
  - If remote ip address is multicast address, enable multicating and set Sn_DHAR, Sn_DIPR, Sn_DPORTR before open socket 
  
v1.2.4 Stable
- Bug fixes:
  - Serial data packing 'time' option does not work if serial command mode switching code is disabled.
  - Fixed typo of debug message

- Improvements
  - Added the PHY init stabilization code
  - Restore TCP connection status function to Status Pin (WIZ750SR-100/105/110 only)
    - The Status pin now acts as an 'HW_Trigger' pin(Input at booting) and a TCP connection status pin(output). 

v1.2.3 Stable
- Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where the pin states could not be saved correctly if the user's GPIO is set to 'Digital Output'

- Improvements:
  - From this version, AppBoot mode supports TCP unicast search function
  	- Until the previous version, AppBoot mode only supported the UDP search function
  	- This is an enhancement to enable firmware update even in device control using TCP unicast search function in new configuration tool

- Changes:
  - The function of the STATUS pin that was responsible for the TCP connection status indicator function has been changed to Command mode switch trigger pin (HW_Trigger).
    - This changes only apply to the WIZ750SR-1xx product family (WIZ750SR-100/105/110, change to maintain compatibility with WIZ100SR)
    - The HW_Trigger pin up to v1.2.2 will no longer work with v1.2.3. The STATUS pin acts as the HW_Trigger.
    
v1.2.2 Stable
- Bug Fixes:
  - Stabilize the network operation of the W7500P devices 
  - Error in setting function in App_Boot mode due to 'TR', 'SC' command processing failure
  - Applied the missing TCP retransmission timeout-value change

v1.2.2 Pre-release
- Bug Fixes:
  - Internal bug fixing (PHY init)
  - Char serial packing option(delimiter) setting does not correctly apply some hex codes
    
- Improvements:
  - Changed the location of the flash erase operation function during network firmware update
    - Now the application area flash memory is erased after socket establishment of TCP connection for the firmware update
  - Extended serial debug message added: 
    - If this option is selected, users can check the sent and received data via the serial debug port. (WIZnet S2E tool GUI version 0.4.0 or later)

- Changes:
  - Changed the TCP retransmission timeout-value from 250ms to 200ms(return to default value)
      - The TCP timeout can be adjusted by the TCP retransmission retry count added in firmware version 1.2.0.

v1.2.1
- Improvements:
  - Enhanced operational stability when performing configuration data save and factory reset functions 

v1.2.1 Pre-release
- Bug Fixes:
  - 'Character' of serial data packing option is not set correctly 

v1.2.0
- Bug Fixes:
  - Data loss problem due to unintended delay in RS-485 mode (WIZ750SR-RS485 only)
  - Incorrect command processing problem: If the processing of a command set containing unsupported commands via Ethernet is sent to WIZ750SR, the device only responds a result until the error occurs
- Improvements:
  - Command added:
    - TR: TCP retransmission retry count adjustment function(WR, param range: 1 ~ 255)
    - BU: AppBoot update function (WO)
  - Changed the firmware update mechanism:
    - The app-backup area is no longer used and flash update operation is only performed in AppBoot mode
  - Now an error message about command processing will be output only during serial command mode operation  
- Known Issues:
  - 'Character' of serial data packing option is not set correctly
    - This issue will be fixed in firmware version 1.2.1

v1.1.2
- Bug Fixes:
  - MAC address changed problem when device settings are saved (very occasionally)
  - Delayed response to search in config-tool when connecting to server in TCP client mode
  - Force socket close when fw update fails occurred
- Improvements:
  - Supports serial baudrate up to 460.8kbps
  - Added device profiles of WIZ750SR-1xx series to project source code

v1.1.1
- Bug Fixes:
  - Firmware update timeout function error in AppBoot mode
  - 10M Ethernet fixed error (W7500P only)
  - Invalid parameter of FW command (firmware update)
- Improvements:
  - Command added: AppBoot mode switching function(AB)
  - Initial boot latency(1500ms) has been removed

v1.1.0
- First release : 2016
